## About the project:
:white_medium_square:	This repository is just for a **learning** purpose: I intend to improve some of my
**python** and **data-science** skills, so I made this project in order to
improve it.

:white_medium_square:	The project has the idea to consume a **.tsv** file generated by windows
**perfmon**, and create some graphics from this file.

###### **What you gonna need to run the code:**
- Matplotlib
- Numpy (todo)

###### **To do:**
- Learn how to consume XML config file
- Create a gui *(maybe?)*
- Create an output file for the filtred data
